## Pet Interaction System

## Value Proposition
**As a** pet lover,

**I want to** interact with my virtual pet through feeding, playing, and training activities,

**so that I** can meet its needs and enhance its well-being.

## Description
By interacting with their pets through feeding, playing, and training, users can directly influence their pet's vital stats, such as health, happiness, and energy. This simulated environment aims to provide a fulfilling experience of pet care.
*Wireframe tbc.*

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement interactive elements like buttons or icons within the pet's profile for various activities:
 - A "Feed" button with a food bowl icon to reduce the pet's hunger.
 - A "Play" button, depicted by a ball or toy icon, to improve the pet's happiness.
 - A "Train" button, shown as a whistle or command icon, to enhance the pet's skills and energy.
- Activating any of these interactive elements should result in immediate visual feedback on the pet's stat bars (`health`, `happiness`, `energy`), indicating the effect of each interaction.
- Include engagement indicators, such as sound effects or animations, that resonate with the chosen interaction to enrich the user experience.
