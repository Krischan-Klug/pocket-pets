## Pet Needs System

## Value Proposition
**As a** pet lover,

**I want to** be alerted to and manage my pet's evolving needs in real-time,

**so that I** can experience the depth of caring for a life, reacting promptly to its survival needs.

## Description
This feature introduces a dynamic system that simulates the fluctuating needs of virtual pets, such as hunger, happiness, and energy. It requires users to engage consistently with their pets, echoing the responsibilities of real pet ownership
*Wireframe tbc.*

## Acceptance Criteria
- Displays dynamic stat bars for hunger, happiness, and energy that automatically adjust over time, simulating the pet's changing needs.
- Stat bars should increment or decrement to  indicating natural rhythms and the consequences of user actions:
  - The `hunger level` increases over time (for example, every six seconds the hunger level increases by 1).
 - The `energy level` decreases over time (for example, every six seconds the hunger level decreases by 1).
 - The `happiness level` decreases over time (for example, every six seconds the hunger level decreases by 1).
- There is an option to feed, rest or play with the animal to reduce the hunger level and increase the energy level and happiness level. 
- Provides visual and auditory alerts for critical need thresholds, ensuring users are aware of urgent care requirements.
- Incorporate noticeable animations or effects to draw attention to urgent needs, ensuring users can prioritize care for pets in distress.
- In a broader view, such as a pet list, include clear indicators (like icons or color changes) for pets in urgent need of care, allowing users to quickly triage and address their needs.
-  If all levels fall above the critical range, the pet is deactivated ğŸ˜µ
> ğŸ’¡ In a subsequent user story, dependencies between the respective levels can be established. For example: If the animal falls into a critical hungry area, the happiness level drops faster.
