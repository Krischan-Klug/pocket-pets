## Update a Pet

## Value Proposition
**As a** pet lover,

**I want to** edit the details of my pets' profiles,

**so that I** can correct any inaccuracies or update their information as needed.

## Description
*Wireframe tbc.*

## Acceptance Criteria
- The detailed view of each pet profile features a prominently displayed "Edit" option, perhaps represented by a pencil icon or a clearly labeled button.
- Activating the "Edit" function transitions the user to an editable form view, where the existing details of the pet are presented in editable fields-
- The editable form includes fields for all relevant pet details, such as:
 - `Pet Name` with a character limit of 1 to 50 - characters.
 - `Pet Type` with dropdown selection for pet types (e.g., Dog, Cat, Bird), including a default "Please select a pet type" option.
 - `Health Level` with a numerical input or slider to set the initial health level, with guidelines on the expected range (e.g., 1-100).
 - `Happiness Level` with a numerical input or slider. 
 - `Hunger Level` with a numerical input or slider. 
 - `Energy Level` with a numerical input or slider.
 - `Pet Emoji/Image` An option to select an emoji (or upload an image) that represents the pet.
- The `Pet Name` and `Pet Type` fields are mandatory for form submission.
- The form section includes options for both saving and cancelling the action.
- The cancellation option allows the user to back out of the edit process if selected by mistake or their changed mind.
- Submissions with empty required fields are blocked, with validation messages guiding completion.
- The changes are saved and updated on the details view and displayed in the list of pets.
