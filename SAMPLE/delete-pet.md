## Delete a Pet

## Value Proposition
**As a** pet lover,

**I want to** have the option to remove pets from my profile,

**so that I** can ensure my pet list remains accurate and up to date, reflecting changes such as the unfortunate loss of a pet.

## Description
*Wireframe tbc.*

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each pet in the list and the details view includes a clear and accessible "Delete" option, possibly represented by a trash can icon or a clearly labeled button.
- The "Delete" option should be intuitive and easy to locate.
- Selecting the "Delete" option prompts a confirmation dialog, helping to prevent accidental deletions by verifying the user's intention.
- The confirmation dialog includes options to either proceed with the deletion or cancel the action, giving users a chance to reconsider or correct mistakes.
- Choosing the cancellation option dismisses the dialog without making any changes, allowing users to safely return to their pet list or pet detail view.
- Upon confirmation of deletion, the pet's profile is immediately removed from the list, and the change is reflected in the user interface without delay.
- Upon confirmation of deletion from the details view, the pet is immediately removed, and the user is redirected back to the pet list.
